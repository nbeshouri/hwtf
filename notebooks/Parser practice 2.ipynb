    "big_text = \"\"\"It is the 24th century. Captain Jean Luc Picard awakens from a nightmare in which he relived his assimilation by the cybernetic Borg six years earlier. He is contacted by Admiral Hayes, who informs him of a new Borg threat against Earth. Picard's orders are for his ship, the USS Enterprise-E, to patrol the Neutral Zone in case of Romulan aggression; Starfleet is worried that Picard is too emotionally involved with the Borg to join the fight. Learning the fleet is losing the battle, the Enterprise crew disobeys orders and heads for Earth, where a single Borg Cube ship holds its own against a group of Starfleet vessels. The Enterprise arrives in time to assist the crew of the USS Defiant and its captain, the Klingon Worf. Picard takes control of the fleet and directs the surviving ships to concentrate their firepower on a seemingly unimportant point on the Borg ship.[2] The Cube is destroyed after launching a smaller sphere ship towards the planet. The Enterprise pursues the sphere into a temporal vortex. As the sphere disappears, the Enterprise discovers Earth has been altered—it is now populated entirely by Borg. Realizing the Borg have used time travel to change the past, the Enterprise follows the sphere through the vortex.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enterprise arrives hundreds of years in its past on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first encounter with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's historic warp drive flight; the crew realizes the Borg are trying to prevent first contact. After destroying the Borg sphere, an away team transports down to Cochrane's ship, the Phoenix, in Montana. Picard has Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane sent back to the Enterprise for medical attention. The Captain returns to the ship and leaves Commander William T. Riker on Earth to make sure the Phoenix's flight proceeds as planned.[4] While in the future Cochrane is seen as a hero, the real man is reluctant to assume the role the Enterprise crew describe.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "A group of Borg invade the Enterprise's lower decks and begin to assimilate its crew and modify the ship. Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with a corrosive gas, but are forced back; the android Data is captured in the melee. A frightened Sloane corners Picard with a weapon, but he gains her trust. The two escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by creating a diversion in the holodeck.[4] Picard, Worf, and the ship's navigator, Lt. Hawk, travel outside the ship in space suits to stop the Borg from calling reinforcements by using the deflector dish. As the Borg continue to assimilate more decks, Worf suggests destroying the ship, but Picard angrily calls him a coward. Sloane confronts the captain and makes him realize he is acting irrationally. Picard orders an activation of the ship's self-destruct while the crew heads for escape pods. The Captain decides to stay behind and rescue his friend Data.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "As Cochrane, Riker, and engineer Geordi La Forge prepare to activate the warp drive on the Phoenix, Picard discovers that the Borg Queen has grafted human skin onto Data, giving him the sensation of touch he has long desired to obtain the android's encryption codes to the Enterprise computer. Although Picard offers himself to the Borg in exchange for Data's freedom, Data refuses to leave. He deactivates the self-destruct and fires torpedoes at the Phoenix. At the last moment the torpedoes miss, and the Queen realizes Data betrayed her.[5] The android ruptures a coolant tank, and the corrosive vapor eats away the biological components of the Borg. With the Borg threat neutralized, Cochrane completes his warp flight.[3] The next day the crew watches from a distance as an alien Vulcan ship, attracted by the Phoenix warp test, lands on Earth. Cochrane and Sloane greet the aliens. Having ensured the correction of the timeline, the Enterprise crew slip away and return to the 24th century.[3]\"\"\"\n",

Also, do not add \"Weasley\" to her surname; that is in-universe format.--> <!--DO not add her birthdate here. That is in-universe format. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction) -->() is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. She first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as a new student on her way to Hogwarts. After Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls' toilets, she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to help them. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself at a younger age, with her insecurity and fear of failure. The character was voted the best female character in a poll conducted amongst Hollywood professionals by The Hollywood Reporter in 2016.who becomes best friends with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. J.K. Rowling states that she was born on 19 September 1979 She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by Rowling as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character. Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but \"very proud of her all the same.\" They are well aware of the wizarding world and have visited Diagon Alley with her. Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, but the planned sibling did not make an appearance in the first Harry Potter novel and, as Rowling noted, it \"seemed too late\" to introduce the character after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rowling has described the character of Luna Lovegood as the \"anti-Hermione\" as they are so different. Hermione's foil at Hogwarts is Pansy Parkinson, a bully based on real-life girls who teased the author during her school days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rowling stated that the character of Hermione carries several autobiographical influences: \"I did not set out to make Hermione like me but she is...she is an exaggeration of how I was when I was younger.\" Rowling also states that her feminist conscience is rescued by Hermione, \"who's the brightest character\" and is a \"very strong female character\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione's first name is taken from a character in William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, though Rowling has said that the two characters have little in common otherwise. Rowling said that she wanted her name to be unusual since if fewer girls shared her name, fewer girls would get teased for it Her original last name was \"Puckle\", but Rowling felt the name \"did not suit her at all\", and so the less frivolous Granger made it into the books.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the books, Hermione is described as having bushy brown hair and brown eyes. Her front teeth, already very large, grow uncontrollably in Goblet of Fire after she is affected by a spell cast by Draco. Madam Pomfrey attends to her in the hospital wing and, at her request, shrinks the teeth down to a normal size for her mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Personality ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione's most prominent features include her prodigious intellect and cleverness. She is levelheaded, book-smart, and very logical. Throughout the series, Hermione uses the skills of a librarian to gather the information necessary to defeat Voldemort. When in doubt, it is to the library that Hermione turns. She is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends—a person who can be counted on. Rowling stated that Hermione is a person that, \"never strays off the path; she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite Hermione's intelligence and bossy attitude, Rowling says that Hermione has \"quite a lot of vulnerability in her personality,\" as well as a \"sense of insecurity underneath,\" feels, \"utterly inadequate... and to compensate, she tries to be the best at everything at school, projecting a false confidence that can irritate people.\" During her Defence against the Dark Arts exam at the end of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hermione reveals that her biggest fear is failure, after a Boggart takes the form of Professor McGonagall and tells her that she has failed all her exams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione is extremely compassionate and is quick to help others, especially those who are defenceless, such as Neville Longbottom, first-years, House-Elves, fellow Muggle-borns, half-giants like Hagrid, and werewolves like Lupin. It was revealed by Rowling after the publication of the final book that Hermione's career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very protective of her friends and values them so much that Rowling has suggested that, if Hermione had looked in the Mirror of Erised, she would have seen Harry, Ron, and herself \"alive and unscathed, and Voldemort finished.\" Hermione has also learned to ignore what bullies such as Draco say to her, often preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart him. She accepts her status as a Muggle-born witch, and states in Deathly Hallows that she is \"a Mudblood and proud of it\".\n",

      "Hermione's Patronus is an otter, Rowling's favourite animal.In the Deathly Hallows book, while they enter the Ministry Of Magic under disguise, Hermione impersonates Mafalda Hopkirk. It is also stated that conjuring a Patronus is the only thing she ever has trouble with. Her wand is made of vine wood and dragon heartstring core; vine is the wood ascribed to Hermione's fictional birth month (September) on the Celtic calendar.\n",

      "== Reception ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Hermione is viewed by many as a feminist icon. In The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter, the first book-length analysis of the Harry Potter series (edited and compiled by Lana A. Whited), a chapter titled \"Hermione Granger and the Heritage of Gender,\" by Eliza T. Dresang, discusses Hermione's role in the series and its relation to feminist debates. The chapter begins with an analysis of Hermione's name and the role of previous characters with the same name in mythology and fiction, and the heritage Hermione has inherited from these characters due to her name. Dresang also emphasises Hermione's parallelism with Rowling herself and how, as Hermione has some attributes from Rowling herself, she must be a strong character.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chapter also points out the fact that, despite being born to Muggle parents, Hermione's magical abilities are innate. Her \"compulsion for study\" helps both the character's development, which makes Hermione \"a prime example that information brings power\", and the plot of the series, as her knowledge of the wizarding world is often used to \"save the day\". Dresang states that \"Harry and Ron are more dependent on Hermione than she is on them.\" However, she also remarks that Hermione's \"hysteria and crying happen far too often to be considered a believable part of the development of Hermione's character and are quite out of line with her core role in the book.\" IGN also listed Hermione as their second top Harry Potter character, praising her character development. In 2016 The Hollywood Reporter conducted a poll of Hollywood professioals, including actors, writers and directors, into their favourite female characters of all time, with Hermione topping the poll.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip Nel of Kansas State University notes that \"Rowling, who worked for Amnesty International, evokes her social activism through Hermione's passion for oppressed elves and the formation of her 'Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare'\".\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in an analysis for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Rowland Manthrope states that \"seven books on, we still only know her as swottish, sensible Hermione—a caricature, not a character.\"\n",

      "Emma Watson portrayed Hermione in all eight Harry Potter films. Watson's Oxford theatre teacher passed her name on to the casting agents of Philosopher's Stone, impressed with her school play performances. Though Watson took her audition seriously, she \"never really thought she had any chance\" of getting the part. The producers were impressed by Watson's self-confidence and she outperformed the thousands of other girls who had applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rowling herself was supportive of Watson after her first screen test. IGN also wrote that her \"astute portrayal of Hermione has already become a favorite among fans.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "<!--More critical reception may be needed; it was suggested in the GA delisting that we have some from her early appearance-->\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the production of Half-Blood Prince, Watson considered not returning, but eventually decided that \"the pluses outweighed the minuses\" and that she could not bear to see anyone else play Hermione.\n",
      "\n",
      "Watson has said that Hermione is a character who makes \"brain not beauty cool,\" and that though Hermione is \"slightly socially inept,\" she is \"not ashamed of herself.\" When filming Chamber of Secrets, Watson was \"adamant\" that she wasn't like Hermione, but she reflects that \"as I got older, I realised she was the greatest role model a girl could have.\" In 2007, before the release of Order of the Phoenix, Watson said, \"There are too many stupid girls in the media. Hermione's not scared to be clever. I think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit, and that's bad. When I was nine or ten, I would get really upset when they tried to make me look geeky, but now I absolutely love it. I find it's so much pressure to be beautiful. Hermione doesn't care what she looks like. She's a complete tomboy.\" Dumezweni described the role as a \"privilege and a responsibility\" and said that \"we all aspire to be Hermione.\" The choice of a black actress to play the part led to criticism on social media, which J.K. Rowling described as being by \"a bunch of racists\", adding that the books never explicitly mentioned her race or skin colour, and that she has been portrayed as black in fan art. Emma Watson also expressed her support for the actress, tweeting that she looked forward to seeing her in the role. Dumezweni herself called the backlash \"so unimaginative\", stating that \"So many young actors and actresses have told me that they’re so pleased I’m playing Hermione because they can see a version of themselves on the stage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dumezweni received praise for her performance; The Independent commented that she \"did a tremendous job as the stern witch.\" At the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards, Dumezweni received the Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of Hermione. On his show Big Impression, Alistair McGowan did a sketch called \"Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone\". It featured impressions of Nigella Lawson as Hermione. In 2003, Comic Relief performed a spoof story called Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan, in which Miranda Richardson, who plays Rita Skeeter in the Harry Potter films, featured as Hermione. Hermione also features in the Harry Bladder sketches in All That, in which she appears as Herheiny and is portrayed by Lisa Foiles. The Wedge, an Australian sketch comedy, parodies Hermione and Harry in love on a \"Cooking With...\" show before being caught by Snape. Hermione also appears as Hermione Ranger in Harry Podder: Dude Where's My Wand?, a play by Desert Star Theater in Utah, written by sisters Laura J., Amy K. and Anna M. Lewis. In the 2008 American comedy film Yes Man, Allison (played by Zooey Deschanel) accompanies Carl (Jim Carrey) to a Harry Potter-themed party dressed as Hermione.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Harry Cover, a French comic book parody of the Harry Potter series by Pierre Veys (subsequently translated into Spanish and English), Hermione appears as Harry Cover's friend Hormone. Hermione also appears in The Potter Puppet Pals sketches by Neil Cicierega, and in the A Very Potter Musical, A Very Potter Sequel, and A Very Potter Senior Year musicals by StarKid Productions played by Bonnie Gruesen in the first two and Meredith Stepien in the third.\n",
