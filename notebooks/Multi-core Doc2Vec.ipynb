       "'Bender Bending Rodríguez (designated in-universe as Bending Unit 22, unit number 1,729, serial number 2716057) is a fictional character who is one of the main characters in the animated television series Futurama. He was created by series creators Matt Groening and David X. Cohen and is voiced by John DiMaggio. He fulfills a comic, antihero-type role in Futurama and is described by fellow character Leela as an \"alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gambler\".\\n\\nAccording to the character\\'s backstory, Bender was built in Tijuana, Mexico (the other characters refer to his \"swarthy Latin charm\"). Viewers are informed, through his own testimony, of Bender\\'s prejudice against non-robots. For example, one of his signature expressions is \"kill all humans\". Exceptions who are not subject to Bender\\'s prejudicial attitude are those individuals on his \"Do Not Kill\" list, which seems to comprise only his best friend Philip J. Fry and his colleague Hermes Conrad (Hermes is added after the episode \"Lethal Inspection\").\\n\\nBender, a high-tech industrial metalworking robot, was built in 2996 at Fábrica Robótica De La Madre (Spanish: \"Mom\\'s Robot Factory\"), a manufacturing facility of Mom\\'s Friendly Robot Company in Tijuana, Mexico. However, the story of his construction remains a mystery. Although different creation processes have been shown, Cohen has stated that the viewer has only been shown Bender emerging from the machine that created him, while what happened inside the machine has not yet been revealed. According to one version, suggested by Hermes\\' flashback,\\n\\nUnlike most other robots, Bender is mortal and, according to Professor Farnsworth\\'s calculations, may have less than one billion years to live. Because of a manufacturing error that left Bender without a backup unit, Bender\\'s memory cannot be transferred or uploaded to another robot body. After reporting that defect to his manufacturer, Bender barely escapes death from a guided missile and a robot death squad dispatched by Mom in order to eliminate him and effectively take the defective product off the market. Bender had a job at the metalworking factory, bending steel girders for the construction of suicide booths.\\n\\nBender has an apartment in the \"Robot Arms Apts.\" building, where he eventually invites his best friend and coworker, Fry, to live with him. Although the pair enjoy living together, Bender is sometimes portrayed as manipulating his guileless friend. In the series\\' early episodes, Bender is shown preferring to occupy smaller areas of their apartment, like the closet, referring to them as \"cozy\", although in later episodes he is shown to have his own individual bedroom, like Fry.\\n\\nThroughout the series, he enters many romantic relationships of varying duration, and is commonly referred to as a womanizer by his friends. He does not seem to discriminate between human women and their robot or \"fem-bot\" counterparts, and is shown actively pursuing both. Likewise, his taste in fem-bot partners does not seem to be affected by the fem-bot\\'s height or weight, and he is shown numerous times chasing fem-bots of all builds. In \"Proposition Infinity\", Bender\\'s secret affair with coworker Amy Wong leads to a referendum that, once approved, legalizes robosexuality. In \"The Bots and the Bees\", he has a sexual encounter with a fem-bot soda vending machine that leads to the almost-instantaneous birth of a son, whom he names Ben, after the first part of his own name.\\n\\nBender hates magnets and has a near-pathological fear of electric can openers, as magnets cause him to uncontrollably start singing folk songs when near his head; magnets shut off his inhibition, causing him to reveal his secret ambition to be a folk singer. He is once able to attach a magnetic small faux-beard underneath his mouth without breaking into song.\\n\\nThe name \"Bender\" was chosen by series creator Matt Groening in homage to the character John Bender from The Breakfast Club.\\n\\nBender\\'s visual design went through multiple changes before reaching its final state. One of the decisions which Matt Groening found to be particularly difficult was whether Bender\\'s head should be square or round. Initially he worked under the idea that all robots would have square heads in the year 3000; however, it was later decided that Bender\\'s head should be round, a visual play on the idea that Bender is a \"round peg in a square hole\".\\n\\nWhen casting for Futurama, Bender\\'s voice was the most difficult to cast, in part because the show\\'s creators had not yet decided what robots should sound like. Because of this, every voice actor who auditioned, no matter for what role, was also asked to read for Bender. After about 300 auditions, even series co-creator Cohen attempted to audition after being told he sounded like a robot. John DiMaggio was eventually chosen for the role after his second audition.\\n\\nDiMaggio originally auditioned using his Bender voice for the role of Professor Farnsworth and used a voice later used for URL the police robot for Bender.\\n\\nHe describes the voice he got the part with as a combination of a sloppy drunk, Slim Pickens, and a character one of his college friends created named \"Charlie the sausage-lover\". Casting directors liked that he made the character sound like a drunk, rather than an automaton. DiMaggio has noted that he had difficulty singing as Bender in \"Hell Is Other Robots\" because he was forced to sing the harmony part in a low key.\\n\\nBender\\'s factory-set height is 5 ft. 6 in. (168 cm); 6 ft. (183 cm) including his antenna. In \"The Farnsworth Parabox\", Bender states that he flipped a coin to decide his color, ending up with foghat gray rather than gold. In \"The Cyber House Rules\", Bender shows the kids a black-and-white mug shot of himself taken after his arrest for theft. In \"Time Keeps on Slippin\\'\", Bender is shown trying to join a basketball team and makes himself taller by simply extending his legs. His body has a \"shiny metal ass\", two legs, two \"Extens-o-matic\" arms with three fingers each, a head with two replaceable eyes shaped like light-emitting diodes, and a mouth used for fuel intake and voice communication. In \"Bender Gets Made\", Bender claims he also has a nose, but he chooses not to wear it. Bender\\'s human-like characteristics are reinforced by his display of behaviors often regarded as exclusive to humans, such as whistling, snoring, having bloodshot eyes, crying, feeling physical attraction, being tickled, dreaming, and belching.\\n\\nOther bending units of the same model as Bender, such as Flexo, share the same hardware design, but differ in terms of their personality and behavior. For example, Flexo shows personality traits similar to those of Bender but is not quite as \"evil\" as Bender. In the episode \"Mother\\'s Day\", Leela looks through a simulation of a bending unit\\'s sight, which targets potential rubes and then denotes a plan to rob them and leave them in a ditch, implying that all bending robots are somewhat prone to theft and amoral by design. However, another unit, Billy West (named after the series voice actor of the same name), is helpful and kind, though he lives as a farmer on the Moon and insists on not being a bending unit.\\n\\nBender\\'s serial number, 2716057, can be expressed as the sum of two cubes, which is humorous to Bender and Flexo after Flexo reveals that his serial number has the same characteristic.\\n\\nBender was designed specifically for the relatively simple task of bending straight metal girders into various angles. Despite this apparent simplicity, he possesses numerous features superfluous to his original purpose, which become more apparent after an electric jolt to his antenna from an overhead light socket in the pilot episode. The scope of Bender\\'s functionality is impressive; he often acts as if he were a multifunctional gadget rather than a special bending machine. Similar to a contemporary computer, he hosts a number of input/output devices: his head has a data socket and remotely operated volume control. His body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket power receptacle, a kill switch,\\n\\nEven when his body is seemingly destroyed or completely detached from his head, it has no effect on Bender\\'s ability to think and communicate, indicating that his main processing facilities are located in his head. Bender\\'s hardware is controlled by a factory-loaded operating system, which reboots upon incidental shutdown and automatically adjusts its settings to the environment detected at the time of rebooting. For example, in \"The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz\", when Bender reboots, his visual sensors detect a colony of penguins, prompting his boot loader to re-initialize him with penguin-like behavior and language.\\n\\nHe is equipped with a vast capacity of computer data storage, in excess of 100,001 terabytes- 1 TB for general storage and 100,000 TB for the storage of pornography, though in 6ACV25 Cubert Farnsworth deletes 12 TB of outdated catchphrases from Bender. Presumably either Bender has a separate \"catchphrase drive\" or the majority of the catchphrases are also pornographic.\\n\\nBender is powered by alcohol-based fuels, which he can convert into an electrical power source sufficient to operate not only himself, but also small household appliances plugged into his power receptacle. Low alcohol intake levels decrease his production of electricity: when he stops drinking and begins to \"sober\", his behavior grows increasingly ebrious and dysfunctional, and he grows a red beard of rust. He is also, apparently, able to sustain himself by consuming mineral oil, though he considers this to be only \\'functional\\'.\\n\\nDue to Professor Farnsworth\\'s flawed design, the energy conversion process inside Bender\\'s body produces an inordinate amount of waste gases and heat. He can expel these products from his rear end In his very first appearance, he tries to commit suicide via a suicide booth out of guilt for having unknowingly contributed to their creation. He has also been known to be nonchalant to the point of appearing both uncaring and incredibly brave, even in life-threatening situations.\\n\\nBender is a classic narcissist. He considers himself flawless, a \"towering inferno of physical perfection\",\\n\\nThe song \"Bend It Like Bender!\" from the Devin Townsend Project album Addicted, is a direct reference to Bender and contains the quote \"Game\\'s over, losers! I have all the money!\"'"
